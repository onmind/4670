In 2008, Stephan G端nzel observed the beginning of a paradigmatic shift in game studies, a paradigm in which games are consistently conceptualised as spatial objects (see also Aarseth, 2001a; Aarseth and G端nzel, 2019; Murray, 1997). This has called for methodological reflections -- it follows that one may take up this question from a variety of approaches, and while G端nzel does so from a phenomenological perspective, the present study adopts an ontological view, asking more specifically: how may researchers practice formal analysis on the spatiality of games? In other words, how may we formalise the ontology of spatiality in game studies? Suggestions as to these questions can be found throughout game studies (most recently Debus, 2019), but no single framework has provided a satisfactory point of departure. Some frameworks are too general, that is, not specialised towards spatiality; some are unduly essentialist and some simply conflate the intricate layers of the game object. This article pursues an ontology that is not essentialist, which is to say, does not aim to define what games -- or their essential components -- are. On the contrary, it formulates four separate levels of game space available to humanistic analysis, and with which scholars may more rigorously study the object at hand.
